# PWA Icons Needed

You need to create two icon files for the PWA to work:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Suggested Design:
- Background: Dark (#111827) or Gold (#D4AF37)
- Symbol: Book icon or "Shavat" text in Cardo font
- Simple, high contrast design

## Quick Creation Options:

### Option 1: Use an online tool
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- Upload a square image (at least 512x512)
- It will generate all needed sizes

### Option 2: Create with design tool
- Use Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
- Create 512x512 canvas
- Export as PNG
- Resize to 192x192 for smaller version

### Temporary Placeholder:
For now, you can use any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images.
Just name them icon-192.png and icon-512.png and place them in /public/

The app will work without icons, but won't be installable as a PWA.
